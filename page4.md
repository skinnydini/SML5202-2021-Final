<hr>

<p style="text-align:center;">As evident from the map pictured above, English is not the only lanuage on the planet. In fact, there are roughly 6,500 languages alive and being spoken as of current! Linguistics aims to study and explore all of human languages, and not just one or two. In order to do this, we must apply our knowledge of linguistics (phonetics, morphology, syntax, and so on) to other world languages! </p>

<hr>

<p>Most people are aware that languages other than their own contain different speech sounds. For example, the Spanish language contains a voiced alveolar trill (refer back to the Building Blocks page to figure out which sound this is!) whereas the English language doesn't. However, other languages also have different morphemes and syntax!</p>

<p>One of the main ways linguists accomplish this is through a process called <strong><u>glossing</u></strong>, or more specifically interlinear glossing. An example of this is shown below:</p>

<pre>
German (cf. 9)

unser-nVÃ¤ter-n
our-DAT.PLfather.PL-DAT.PL
'to our fathers' (cf. singular Vater)
</pre>

<p>To dissect the above example, the term 'interlinear glossing' stems from the idea that it occurs between the source text and the translation. In glossing, the original transcription is divided into morphemes, and then each of those morphemes are translated. The importance of glossing lies in the fact that sometimes, one language conveys a particular meaning through use of a word, whereas others use an affix or inflection, etc. Often word by word translation isn't accurate enough, and that is when morpheme by morpheme glossing is important.</p>

<hr>

<p>As seen in the red example, the morpheme glossed as 'PL' signifies plurality. There are entire directories of linguistically accepted glossing abbreviations, and one of these can be found on <a href="https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php">this page</a> alongside other examples like the one above.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Touching on Syntax</h2>

<hr>

<p>Syntax is one of the most important topics for interlanguage study, and this is the primary reason it can become so complex. Perhaps the easiest example of syntax in linguistic study, without delving too deep, is the differing word orders in modern European languages. For example, English and French have an entirely different ordering and positioning convention for adjectives when compared to eachother. Take the example below:</p>

<pre>
English: Big black car
French: Grosse voiture noire
Translation with French word-order maintained:
Big car black 
</pre>
